This data correspond to the k-space analysis of the LOWZ and CMASS DR12 catalogues.

If you use this data, please refer apporpiately to these papers,
Pre-recon refers to http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw1096
Post-recon refers to http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw1264

LOWZ sample has a redshift range of 0.15<z<0.43 with an effective redshift of zeff=0.32
CMASS sample has a redshift range of 0.43<z<0.7 with an effective redshift of zeff=0.57

For both CMASS and LOWZ catalogues, the cosmology used for transforming redshfits into comoving distances is Om=0.31. This number applies as well to the mocks used to generate the covariance matrix, regardless of their true value of Om. 

Each sub-folder contains:
1. Data catalogues for the averaged weighted between NGC and SGC, along with their diagonal errorbars. 

The number of k-bins is 53 for LOWZ and 55 for CMASS, from k=0.0015 to k=0.3 h/Mpc, with a logarithmic binning.
This can be found in the files with the name "GilMarin_2016_ZZZZDR12_measurement_power_spectrum_XXXXX_YYYY_recon.txt"

2. Best-fitting model performance presented in the paper.
"GilMarin_2016_ZZZZDR12_bestfit_power_spectrum_XXXXX_YYYY_recon.txt"
The post-recon besfit models corresopond to BAO analyses described in 1509.06373, and the pre-recon models correspond to RSD analysis described in 1509.06386

3. Covariance matrix For P0-P2 and P0-Pmu2
These covariances are (53*2)x(53*2) for LOWZ and (55*2)x(55*2) for CMASS.

4. Window matrix
These covariances are 53x1000 for LOWZ and 55x1000 for CMASS. There are 4 difference covariance matrix taking into acount the effect of the underlying monopole and quadrupole into the measured monopole and quadrupole: W00, W02, W20 and W22. 
The way these window matrices should be applied to describe the effect of the window is described in Eq. 15 of 1509.06386 

The rows correspond to the k-values of the data files, whereas the columns correspond to the k-values written in the GilMarin_2016_XXXXDR12_kinput_window.txt file

In all cases, the errors and covariances have been computed using the Patchy mocks.
